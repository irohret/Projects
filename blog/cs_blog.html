        <h3>What is Computer science?</h3>
        <p>
        Computer science is the study of computing technology, programming languages, algorithms, software engineering, data structures, computer architecture, and other topics related to the design, development, and analysis of computer systems. It involves both theoretical and practical aspects, including the study of how computers and computer programs work, as well as the development of new applications and technologies. Computer scientists work on a wide range of problems, from designing new algorithms for data analysis to developing new software applications for a variety of industries. Computer science plays an increasingly important role in our world, and its applications are seen in fields such as healthcare, finance, education, and entertainment, among others.
        </p>

        <h3> What Should I know?</h3>
        <p>
        Computer science is an ever-evolving field with numerous career opportunities, making it an attractive choice for individuals who have a passion for technology and innovation. Although I will try to simplify the field, here are some things that you should know before getting started. 
 
        Understanding the fundamentals of computer science is crucial. This involves knowing the basics of programming languages, algorithms, data structures, and computer organization. It is important to have a good grasp of these fundamental concepts to build a strong foundation for more advanced topics. This blog will mostly be focused on builing a strong fundamental and giving you the resources and tool to explore after that. 

        Technology and Computer Scinecey are rapidly changing field, and keeping up with the latest developments is crucial to remain relevant and competitive. The best way to run with the hered is to practice. Practicing programming and problem-solving is the best way to learn and improve your skills. Creating projects, participating in coding competitions, and collaborating with other computer science enthusiasts can help you hone your skills and gain real-world experience. And lastly, having a strong understanding of mathematics is important. You may find out that perfored field may not reqire a vast know of mathematics but many computer science concepts are rooted in mathematics, and having a good foundation in math is essential for understanding and excelling in computer science.
