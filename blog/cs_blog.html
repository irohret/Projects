    <h1>What is Computer science?</h1>
    <p>
      Computer science is the study of computing technology, programming languages, algorithms, software engineering, data structures, computer architecture, and other topics related to the design, development, and analysis of computer systems. It involves both theoretical and practical aspects, including the study of how computers and computer programs work, as well as the development of new applications and technologies. Computer scientists work on a wide range of problems, from designing new algorithms for data analysis to developing new software applications for a variety of industries. Computer science plays an increasingly important role in our world, and its applications are seen in fields such as healthcare, finance, education, and entertainment, among others.
